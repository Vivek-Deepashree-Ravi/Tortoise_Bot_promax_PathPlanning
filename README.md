# Tortoise_Bot_promax_PathPlanning
 Project aims to leverage the powerful combination of the Navigation Stack 2 (Nav2) and Cartographer within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable autonomous navigation for robotic platforms. 


This workspace has been tested with ROS Noetic.This directory contains all the code used for Cartographer based SLAM Algorithms.
